Gee what another post today!

Golly! I've got a lot to say today.  Let me tell you about all the things I'm
going to post about.  There's just so much!!

Posting about the things I want to post about really makes me think about
blogging about things.  I get so many ideas!  When I get ideas I better jot
them down.  Where better than in my blog!  Blogging is great for writing
things down where they can be later read!

This post is just one of many great examples.  Look at me write about the
things.  The more I write, the more blog posts I have.  That can only be a
good thing!
